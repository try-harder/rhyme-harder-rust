# Rust implementation of the simple TDD task for Rhyme Harder

## Compiling and Running

1. install Rust by following the instructions here: [http://doc.rust-lang.org/doc/tutorial.html#installation]
2. compile with `rustc -g --test rhyme-harder.rs`
3. run with `./rhyme-harder`

If you're running windows, these steps will probably have to be modified slightly, by adding the odd `.exe` here and there perhaps.
